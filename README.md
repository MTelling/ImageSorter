#ImageSorter

This is a simple home project for looking through all images in a folder and sorting them according to date and camera. 

I recommend using a virtual python environment for running the script. 

Use the command *pip install -r requirements.txt* to install required dependencies.

In the script specify root folder to go through and the dest_folder to where you want the images to be copied to. Then run the script with *python main.py*.
